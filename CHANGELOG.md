## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Quotes Management API under the `api/v1` prefix: public (no auth required) full CRUD plus combined search (`filter[search]` across text and author via a `scopeSearch` ILIKE scope), field filters, sorting, and pagination.
- Filament back-office resource for Quotes (modular `Schemas`/`Tables`/`Pages` structure under the `Data Master` navigation group), accessible by `admin` and `staff` roles.
- Automated feature tests for the Quotes API (guest access, search/filter/sort/pagination, full CRUD cycle) and back-office page smoke tests.
- Comprehensive step-by-step tutorials detailing best practices for adding a new API to the project, using a "Quotes" CRUD & search use case, covering migrations, models, factories, RBAC policies, Filament integration, and testing (stored under `docs/tutorial/`, `docs/tutorial_claude_opus/`, and `docs/tutorial_claude_opus4.7/`).
- Excel Import and Export APIs (`GET /api/users/export` and `POST /api/users/import`) using the `maatwebsite/excel` package, with strict row validation and upsert logic.
- Standardized `ApiErrorCode` enum under `App\Support\Enums` to enforce robust API response schemas (`CF-027`).
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline configuration (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to validate linting, phpstan, and phpunit against PostgreSQL (`CF-025`).
- Developer shortcuts using a root `Makefile` (`CF-029`).
- Production Deployment Guide under `docs/deployment.md` (`CF-030`).
- GitHub Contribution templates for Bug Reports, Feature Requests, and Pull Requests (`CF-032`).
- Premium Dark Mode logo variation (`public/images/logo-dark.svg`) registered dynamically within Filament AdminPanelProvider (`CF-033`).
- Comprehensive architectural and usage documentation for GCS Assets Management System under `docs/features.md` (`CF-034`).
- Custom premium visual Feature Card for Assets & GCS on Welcome page `resources/views/welcome.blade.php` (`CF-035`).
- Mandatory rules and steps for updating the changelog added to `CONTRIBUTING.md` (`CF-036`).
- Modal-based `EditAction` in both list view (table record actions) and detail view (header actions) in the Filament Back-Office Asset Resource to allow editing asset metadata (`category`, `retain_until`, `is_protected`) while dynamically hiding it when an asset is hard deleted.

### Changed
- Displayed `hard_deleted_at` timestamp in Filament Back-Office detail view infolist schema (`AssetInfolist`) under the Metadata & Audit section to show when an asset was hard deleted.
- Resolved `status` badge visual inconsistency in Filament Back-Office detail view infolist schema by mapping status colors (`success`, `warning`, `danger`) to match the list table.
